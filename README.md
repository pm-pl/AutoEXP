## 📫 • General:

 - Plugin Introduction: 

   > AutoEXP is a simple plugin for PocketMine-MP that allows server lag to be reduced by forwarding XP directly to the player instead of dropping it on the floor. This helps a lot since many times when killing, mining or performing actions, players end up not being able to get the XP and it stays there for a long time, causing a lot of lag and delays in this area of ​​the server. Also other players can get the dropped XP, so this plugin is also useful to avoid that!
